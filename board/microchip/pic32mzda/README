PIC32MZ[DA] Starter-Kit
----------------------------------------
PIC32MZ[DA] Starter Kit is based on PIC32MZ[DA] family of micro-controller.
This family is powered by MIPS M14KEC 32bit general purpose core with advanced
microcontroller features and peripherals.

This processor boots with proprietary stage1 bootloader running from on-chip
boot-flash. Stage1 bootloader locates and jumps to U-Boot programmed on
another onchip program flash. Finally U-Boot locates and loads OS image
(along with other required files for booting) from either uSD card, or
ethernet, or from USB storage connected on-chip USB controller.

To boot Linux following three files are mandatory - uEnv.txt (custom U-Boot
environment file), uImage, *.dtb (platform device-tree-blob file).

U-Boot jumps to Linux using UHI specification.
