* Microchip PIC32 Clock and Oscillator

The PIC32 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
controllers within the SoC.

Required Properties:

- compatible: should be "microchip,pic32mzda_clk"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- #clock-cells: should be 1.

Example: Clock controller node:

	clock: clk@1f801200 {
		compatible = "microchip,pic32mzda_clk";
		reg = <0xbf801200 0x1000>;
	};

Example: UART controller node that consumes the clock generated by the clock
  controller:

	uart1: serial@1f822000 {
		compatible = "microchip,pic32mzda-uart";
		reg = <0xbf822000 0x50>;
		interrupts = <112 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&clock PB2CLK>;
	};
